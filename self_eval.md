# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I believe I'm pretty good at comparisons. I would still like to practice them though.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
I did have some trouble in the beginning. After making the corrections to the exercises, I feel like I usderstand them better.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
It took me around an hour to an hour in a half to complete the assighment. I predicted that it would only take me a couple of hours, so I believe I was able to follow my schedule.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I believe that I do need to polish up on if statements. I was able to watch videos on them during my break times.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
My question has already been answered. We don't have to use elsif when there is only 2 possible outcomes. If there are more, then we use elsif.
